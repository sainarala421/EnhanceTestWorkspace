/*
 * This Jenkinsfile is intended to run on https://ci.jenkins.io and may fail anywhere else.
 * It makes assumptions about plugins being installed, labels mapping to nodes that can build what is needed, etc.
 *
 * The required labels are "java" and "docker" - "java" would be any node that can run Java builds. It doesn't need
 * to have Java installed, but some setups may have nodes that shouldn't have heavier builds running on them, so we
 * make this explicit. "docker" would be any node with docker installed.
